# Basic programming

Below you will find programming exercises of increasing complexity. Each exercise has a corresponding Python file in the `src/` directory that you should modify.

Do not worry if you do not get through all of the exercises. I have tried to cover a wide range of difficulties, so there is a challenge for those who have never programmed before and those who already have some experience. Make it as far as you can, and don't sweat it if it isn't everything.

Give each exercise a go, though, because sometimes you can get stuck on a medium-hard problem and still handle a harder one, simply because the difficulty is highly subjective.

Don't forget that you can get help by writing a comment in the `Feedback` pull request that tags me (@mailund). However, since my time is limited and I am teaching two and a half courses this term, responses might be slow for weekly exercises. I will get to it, but it can take a little while, so make sure that you are properly stuck before you give up and ask for help.

You might be able to get faster feedback from your fellow students. They can see your `Feedback` pull request as well, if you give them the URL to your repository, so you might consider that. If you do, you should also offer to review their code as well.

You can also formally ask for a review on GitHub. If you go to your `Feedback` pull request and look at the right side-bar, you should see "Reviewers" at the top.

If you click the gear icon, you get a drop-down with the GitHub handles of your fellow students (and me).

You can pick someone there--*after you have checked that they are okay with this*--and ask for a review. Then they will be notified by GitHub.

This, of course, might be overkill for weekly exercises, but I suggest you consider it for the mandatory projects. Having another set of eyes looking at your code can be a great help.

Anyway, let's get started with the exercises...

## Hello, World!

It is tradition, when you start programming or when you start learning a new programming language, that the first program you write is one that prints the string `"Hello, World!"` to the terminal.

We will not break this tradition, and anger the programming gods, so change the code in `src/hello.py` so it prints that exact string.
